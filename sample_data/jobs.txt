Hermit, Some Distant Planet  (5432 -5445)

Built a hut, talked to some dingy girl that wanted to ask a lot of questions. Bribed her to go away with an X Wing; best deal I ever made.


Traveller, All over the Galaxy (5424 - 5432)

Got lost, never bothered asking for directions. Who knew these old rebel fighters were so comfy for long trips?


Galactic Hero, All over the Galaxy (5400 - 5424)

Every place I go, always the same question: "How did it feel to kiss your sister?" 


Farm Hand, Tatoonie (5382 - 5400)

Working the family farm; harvesting dirt. Hightly successful.
